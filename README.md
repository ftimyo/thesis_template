Read "main.tex". It should be self-explanatory.

This template just gets you started with
the basics of how a disseratation/thesis should look.

This template is designed so that you can just
"fill stuff in". I assumed you've used latex
before at least a little bit, so you should
already have your own macros for including
figures and formulas and stuff. I do not include
help for any of that kind of stuff.

That's what google is for.

To "compile" the document, just type "make".

type "make clean" to clean up the intermediate files.

Enjoy...
